### Hour 1: Initial Implementation

1. **Developer#1:** Begin implementing the mining section. Set up the grid-based tilemap and basic player movement controls (WASD).
2. **Developer#2:** Start working on the upgrade section. Set up the UI framework and basic functionality for displaying available upgrades and their costs.
3. **Developer#3:** Set up the defense section scene. Implement turret placement mechanics and basic enemy spawning.
4. **Artist:** Work on asset collection. Start creating or gathering necessary art assets such as sprites for tiles, ores, characters, UI elements, turrets, enemies, etc.

### Hour 2: Development

1. **Developer#1:** Continue with the mining section. Implement ore generation, currency system, and basic player interactions (digging for ores).
2. **Developer#2:** Polish the upgrade section. Finalize UI design, ensure smooth functionality for upgrade purchasing mechanics, and add visual feedback for purchased upgrades.
3. **Developer#3:** Proceed with the defense section. Implement enemy spawning and movement mechanics. Set up turrets to automatically target and attack enemies within range.
4. **Artist:** Continue creating necessary art assets. Prioritize assets needed for sections being developed by the developers.

### Hour 3: Refinement and Testing

1. **All Developers:** Perform integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between sections. Address any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
2. **All Developers:** Assist each other with polishing and refining their respective sections. Make adjustments based on feedback from playtesting.
3. **Artist:** Finalize remaining art assets. Polish UI elements, adjust sprites for better visual clarity, and ensure consistency across all sections.
4. **All:** Conduct final playtesting to ensure a balanced gameplay experience. Make any necessary adjustments to gameplay mechanics, balancing, or UI elements.
